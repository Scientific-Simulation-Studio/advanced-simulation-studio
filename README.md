The poducts  plan, let's fighting for Material Studios !!!

## Introduction
- A firm specializing in research software for computational chemistry, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, molecular dynamics simulation, and quantum mechanics.
- This software is used in advanced research of various materials, such as polymers, carbon nanotubes, catalysts, metals, ceramics, and so on, by universities , research centers, and high tech companies.


## Software components
- Analytical and Crystallization: to investigate, predict, and modify crystal structure and crystal growth.
- Morphology
- Polymorph Predictor
- Reflex, Reflex Plus, Reflex QPA: to assist the interpretation of diffraction data for determination of crystallic structure, to validate the results of experiment and computation.
- X-Cell: indexing for medium- to high-quality powder diffraction data from X-ray, neutron, and electron radiation sources.
- Quantum and Catalysis
- Adsorption Locator: to find the most stable adsorption sites for various materials, including zeolites, carbon nanotubes, silica gel, and activated carbon
- CASTEP: to predict electronic, optical, and structural properties
- ONETEP: to perform linear-scaling density functional theory simulations
- DMol3: quantum mechanical methods to predict materials properties
- Sorption: to predict fundamental properties, such as sorption isotherms (or loading curves) and Henry's constants
- VAMP: high-speed calculation of a variety of physical and chemical molecular properties, e.g., for quick screening during drug discovery
- QSAR, QSAR Plus: to identify compounds with optimal physicochemical properties.
- Polymers and Classical Simulation: to construct and characterize models of isolated chains or bulk polymers and predict their properties
- Materials Component Collection
- Materials Visualizer


## Basic workflow
 - Materials Visualizer is used to construct/import graphical models of materials.
 - Accurate structure is determined by quantum mechanical, semi-empirical, or classical simulation.
 - Various required properties may be predicted/analyzed.
